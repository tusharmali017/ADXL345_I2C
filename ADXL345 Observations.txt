ADXL345 module(Robu SKU: 699522) interfacing with PIC1632 Dev Board-
--------------------------------------------------------------------


Observations-

1. R4 and R5 are zero ohm resistors mounted on ADXL345 module. If both are there, SPI and I2C are not working properly.

2. If R4 is removed, SPI works properly but I2C works in the mode when SDO is set High externally. If SDO is set Low, I2C is not working.

3. If R4 and R5 both the resistors are removed from ADXL345 module, then SPI and I2c(in both modes) works correctly.

4. Current program is working correctly after removing R4 and R5 resistors.
